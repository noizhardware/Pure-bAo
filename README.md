### TODO
  * I'm writing nice -help files, and debugging/tidying the abstractions in the process, some helpfiles are just copies of the abstractions (there is some documentation in some of the patches themselves, tho)
  * add "~" to signal related objects? (I actually don't like having to type the tilde every time...)
